### Small and simple RPG encounter test application using  Three.js techstack
This will be my first repo using the Three.Js tech stack. I'm currently aiming to get a very crude and simple demo working for a small RPG encounter, then building features from there.

## Currently a very early WIP!!!!
Proceed at your own discretion...
### At the moment, this is nothing more than a Three.js Hello World rotating cube. 
I will come back to this, but I believe at the moment that Three.js will not be the stack I'm actually interested in for my current needs.
